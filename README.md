# 🎮 Video Games Sales Prediction ML

# 📌 **Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze and predict global video game sales using machine learning models. By exploring historical data on game performance, platform trends, genre popularity, and publisher impact, we aim to identify key factors that influence global sales volume. This project involves:

- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features like Platform, Genre, and Publisher
- Feature analysis
- Training regression models to predict Global_Sales
- Evaluating model performance and interpreting results
This analysis helps uncover insights into what makes a video game successful in terms of worldwide sales.
